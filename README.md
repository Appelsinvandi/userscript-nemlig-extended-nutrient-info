# Userscript - Nemlig Extended Nutrient Info

A simple userscript that adds macronutrients and some extra advisory info to nemlig food.

# Versions

The script usually change quite a bit between major versions, so every previous major version remains in a maintenance mode state.

## 2.x.x

_This is the current mainline version._

With this release the extended nutrient info is moved out of the food declaration section, into a fixed floating element. This will negate the need to ever scroll to see the extended nutrient info. In addition, it also adds nutrient advisory messages.
