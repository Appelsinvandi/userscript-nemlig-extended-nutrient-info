![Preview](.static/preview.png)

Going from top to bottom the displayed information is as follows.

## Allergen information

The userscript reads the item's ingredient list and looks for known allergens, these are what can be seen at the very top of the preview image. Please be advised that the userscript might _miss_ an allergen, either due to a spelling mistake in the ingredient list or an error in the userscript.

Currently the following allergies are supported:

| Allergen       | Â Reliability |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| Eggs           | Good         |
| Fish           | Fair         |
| Gluten         | Good         |
| Milk / Lactose | Very good    |
| Peanut         | Fair         |
| Sesame         | Fair         |
| Shellfish      | Fair         |
| Soy            | Fair         |
| Tree nut       | Fair         |
| Wheat          | Good         |

I'm continually adding new allergens and improving the reliability of existing allergens, when I become aware of something missing.

## Dietary advisory

Based on the nutritional information provided for the item, the userscript will deliver some dietary advisories, this is what is seen in the middle of the preview image. These advisories are meant to make you aware of certain good and bad qualities of the item you are viewing, helping you make better decisions for a healthier diet.
